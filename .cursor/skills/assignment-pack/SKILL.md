  Reads any lab assignment pack (instructions, acceptance criteria, rubric,

  then implements in scoped increments and re-grades until every cell is
  Excellent and every criterion is met. Use when working an assignment pack

# Assignment pack

Orchestrate a lab day for any assignment pack. Do not create one agent that implements until it thinks it scored 100.

Pack discovery, agent naming, and Task launch: [reference.md](reference.md).
Agent file skeletons: [templates.md](templates.md).

## 1. Locate the pack

If the user names a folder, use it. Else search `docs/`, `docs/assignment*/`, and `assignments/` for files by **role** (filename or title), not a fixed claims-intake path.

Required to start:

- **Instructions** — `instructions`, `overview`, `overview`, or `assignment` (not acceptance/rubric)
- **Acceptance criteria** — `acceptance-criteria`

**Rubric** (`rubric`, with `##` cells) is required for cell graders. If it is missing, run only the AC gate.

Optional roles: contract/interface, relevant-changes/constraints, `feedback.md`, `articles/`. `notes/` is never authority.

Record pack root and slug (folder name, e.g. `w02-02` or `assignment-week2-day2`). See [reference.md](reference.md).

## 2. Read before writing agents or code

Read instructions, acceptance criteria, and rubric (if present) in full. Then only the contract, constraints, and product docs the instructions name.

Read `articles/` only for method (scoping, test-first, review). Articles are not the spec.

## 3. Author graders, then persist them

Write files under `.cursor/agents/`. Reuse existing files for **this pack** if the pack has not changed. Do not overwrite graders that belong to a different pack.

New agents: `<slug>-<cell-slug>`. Gate: `<slug>-acceptance-criteria`.

**Binary gate.** Every acceptance criterion, every out-of-scope / deliverable check, optional feedback items. Verdict: all met or unmet. No points.

**Cell grader.** One per `##` heading in the rubric. Score only that cell. Copy the Excellent row into the prompt; do not paraphrase it. Skip cell graders if there is no rubric.

Each body lists files to read (pack + named product docs + deliverable source/tests), the Excellent checklist or numbered AC list, **do not edit the codebase**, and the output format. Fill from [templates.md](templates.md).

## 4. Same-session launch

Newly written types may not appear in `Task.subagent_type` until a new chat.

This session: `Task` with `subagent_type: generalPurpose` and the generated prompt as the body.
Next session: use the custom type if it is listed.

## 5. Plan increments from instruction steps

Work in instruction order, not rubric-cell order. Each increment is three sentences:

1. **Outcome** — what will be true; its absence would be obvious.
2. **Authority** — file and section the work must satisfy.
3. **Boundary** — files that must not change. If the contract appears wrong, stop and tell the user rather than editing it.

If the instructions require test-first or a commit of failing tests before implementation, that sequence is the grade. Do not squash tests and implementation. Do not open the implementation file while writing those tests.

Git commits are in-scope only when the assignment grades sequence. See [reference.md](reference.md).

## 6. Implement

Implement in this parent, or spawn a **narrow** `generalPurpose` slice against already-failing tests (outcome, authority, boundary; tests must not be modified).

Never spawn “complete the assignment” or “keep going until Excellent.”

## 7. Grade after an increment

Launch the cell graders that cover what just changed. Launch the AC gate before declaring the lab done. If a rubric does not have an explicit "excellent" label for the categories, grade basde on the point values (highest point value for each category being the "excellent" criteria and so on). 

A “not Excellent” or unmet criterion is a new scoped task, not a reason to keep the same session spinning. Restart if the same misunderstanding is corrected twice.

## 8. Done

Stop only when the gate says **all criteria met** and every cell grader (if any) says **Excellent**.
